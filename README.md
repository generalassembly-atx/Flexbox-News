# Flexbox News

Today we got a taste of what the new CSS3 flexbox system is all about. The code along we did was based off of a tutorial on the web.

Let's go through that tutorial in order to solidify what we've learned about flex box.

Tutorial Here: [Flexbox Tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-news-website-layout-with-flexbox--cms-26611)

**Steps:**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your computer.

2. Write your code inside of the `news_layout` directory. HTML will go inside of index.html, and our css will go inside of css/main.css. Feel free to get creative, change the colors/ font!

3. Push your code back up to the forked repository.

4. Send a pull request.

Of course you could always copy and paste the code that's provided. However, if you are serious about learning this will not help you.

We look forward to seeing what you come up with, happy hacking!!
